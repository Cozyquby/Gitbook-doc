# Freshdesk  

Freshdesk can be integrated into the iMBrace platform using an API key for a given user account.  

## Account integration using API key  

To begin, you will need:  

- A Freshdesk Support Desk account.
- Access to your Freshdesk dashboard.  

**STEP 1**: In the top-right corner, go to your account’s **[Profile Settings]**.  
**STEP 2**: Copy the **API key** in the right column.  
**STEP 3**: Identify the **subdomain** of your Freshdesk account. This is the part of the URL before  
“**.freshdesk.com**” (in the example below, the subdomain is “imbrace-help”.)  
**STEP 4**: In iMBrace, create a new credential of type **Freshdesk API** and enter the API key. Enter  
the subdomain in the **Domain** field. Then click **[Submit]**.

**DONE**: The credential can then be used for Freshdesk nodes.
