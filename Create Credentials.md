# Create Credentials

## Adding new Channel Credentials is similar to creating a new channel, whereas  
## creating an Integration Credential doesn't automatically create a channel, it is  
## for additional services.  


To add credentials to your account, follow these steps:  

**Step 1:** Go to the "**Credentials**" section and select the type of credential you want to add:  

1. **Channels** \- Select a channel provided on the page: **Web Widget**, **WhatsApp**, **Facebook**, **LINE**,  
**WeChat** or **Instagram**. The credentials are linked to specific channels and requested during  
 the channel creation process.

2. **Integrations** \- Select an additional service you want to use. Integration Credentials are used to  
connect with third-party services like Salesforce, Google Calendar, etc. Those contain  
sensitive information and are stored for a workflow connector to access the third-party  
service.  

**Step 2:** Follow the prompts to fill out all the required credentials fields.  

**Step 3:** Once you've added the necessary information, click "**Create**"  or "**Connect**" to save the  
new credential.  

**Step 4:** To edit or delete an existing credential, select the credential from the Credentials page and  
make the necessary changes.  

With the steps above, you can easily add, edit, or delete credentials for your account, making it  
easier to connect with various channels and third-party services.
