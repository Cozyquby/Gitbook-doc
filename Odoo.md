# Odoo

Odoo can be integrated into the iMBrace platform using an API key for a given user account.  

## Account integration using API key  

To begin, you will need:  

- An Odoo account with access to the CRM app.  

**STEP 1**: In the top-right corner, go to your account’s **[Preferences]**.  
**STEP 2**: Go to **[Account Security] > [API keys]** and create a new API key.  
**STEP 3**: Name your new key and click **[Generate Key]**.  
**STEP 4**: You will then be provided with the **API key** to copy and paste.  
**STEP 5**: Identify your Odoo **site URL** (e.g. “imbrace-1.odoo.com”) and **database name**, which is the  
first part of the URL (e.g. “imbrace-1”).  
**STEP 6**: In iMBrace, create a new credential of type **Odoo API** and enter the relevant information  
into the corresponding fields. Then click **[Submit]**.  

**DONE**: The credential can then be used for Odoo nodes.
