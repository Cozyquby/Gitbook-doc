### WhatsApp Official Buisness Account  

**WhatsApp Business Accounts** are accounts meant to represent businesses on WhatsApp. These  
accounts are able to acquire a green checkmark next to their name by becoming an **Official  
Business Account (OBA)**.  

WhatsApp provides three levels of Business Accounts:  

| Account Type                   | Key differences                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (Unverified) Business Account  | Can message customers immediately. Customers will see the **phone number** of that account if they have not saved it in their contact list. |
| Verified Business Account      | Business Accounts that have completed [Business Verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1095661473946872?id=180505742745347). Customers will see the **display name** of the business account with **no checkmark**. |
| Official Business Account (OBA)| Customers will see the **display name** of the business with a **green checkmark** after the name.           |
