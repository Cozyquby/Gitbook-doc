# Invite organization members


To invite new members to your organization, please follow these simple steps: (Admin only)  
**Step 1:** Go to the **Settings** section and select **Org Members**. Once there, click "**ADD NEW**  
**MEMBER**" on the top right corner of the page.

**Step 2:** Then, you have two options to invite the members:

1.  **INVITE** \- To invite a single member, enter their email address and select a role from the  
    available options. Click "**NEXT**" and then "**ADD TO ORGNIZATION**" to confirm.
2.  **BATCH INVITE** \- To invite multiple members at once, upload a new member list file using the  
    provided template and click "**UPLOAD**".

The roles available are **Member**, **Admin**, and **Super Admin**.

1.  **Member** \- A Member can access the "**Conversations**", "**Contact**", and "**My Teams**" pages.    
2.  **Admin** \- An admin has **full access to all pages** and can add other admins/members, deactivate  
    members, connect to channels, set up workflows and other settings.  
3.  **Super Admin** \- A Super Admin is essentially the first point of organization members, this role  
    can do everything Admins and Members can do and deactivate other admins/members.  

Once you've completed the steps, the new members will be added to the member  list.  

**Note:** The **Organization roles** and **Team roles** are **irrelevant**. Organization Admin can be the Team  
Representative, also the Organization Member can be the Team admin.
