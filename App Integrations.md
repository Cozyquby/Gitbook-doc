# App Integrations

Using the underlying iMBrace system, the workflow platform allows users to perform automated  
tasks on other apps (e.g. Slack, Shopify, CRM software) using the APIs they provide.  

In many cases, this requires users to create **API keys** in the respective apps, and create  
**credentials** in iMBrace to store those API keys. This allows the iMBrace platform to perform tasks  
on the user's behalf.  

Alternatively, **OAuth** can be used to authenticate a user to a service through iMBrace. This allows  
iMBrace to perform tasks with the same permissions as the user has on the respective apps.  

This section provides step-by-step guides to common app integrations.
